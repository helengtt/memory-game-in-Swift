# memory-game-in-Swift

## Project Introduction
This is a matching game project on iPhone. The goal of this assignment is to make enhancements based on the demonstration given in lecture.

## Tasks
1. Add more cards to the game.
2. Add a “New Game” button to your UI which ends the current game in progress and begins a brand new game.
3. Shuffle the cards.
4. Move the flip count away from the Controller and make a proper MVC architecture.
5. Give the game the concept of a “theme”. A theme determines the set of emoji from which cards are chosen. All emoji in a given theme are related by that theme. The game should have at least 6 different themes and
should choose a random theme each time a new game starts.
6. Add a game score label to UI. Score the game by giving 2 points for every match and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card that is involved in a mismatch.
